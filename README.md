"The only way to do great work is to love what you do"
o What UI/UX principles did you apply and why?
I made the design easy to use and understand.
I kept the look consistent so it feels familiar.
I organized things so important stuff stands out.
I made sure it works well on phones and computers.
I kept it clean and not too busy.
o What challenges did you face and how you solved them?
It was hard to make it creative but simple. I used cool but not distracting designs.
Showing different types of work was tricky, so I grouped projects by category.
Loading pictures quickly without losing quality was tough, so I made images smaller but still good-looking.
Making it easy for everyone to use, including people with disabilities, so I followed accessibility rules.
o How would you improve the portfolio next?
Add stories about each project to explain how I worked on them.
Show interactive examples so people can try my work.
Add personal touches to show who I am.
Let visitors send feedback easily.
Use new design trends to keep it fresh.
Improve how people find my portfolio online.
